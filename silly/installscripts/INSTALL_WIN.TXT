Hello. Thank you for being a Windows Silly Widgets consumer.

Since you've obviously decompressed the Silly Widgets package, you're now ready to use the 'silly' command to build your static site.

To be able to use the 'silly' command from anywhere, you'll need to add <this install directory> to your PATH environment variable. Here's how to do this:

1. Open up Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings
2. Click Environment Variables...
3. Either for User or System variables, or both, select PATH and click Edit...
4. Append <this install directory> to the end and Save

Now you'll be able to enjoy 'silly' from any directory on your computer. Have fun.
