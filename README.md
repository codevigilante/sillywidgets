# sillywidgets v0.3

A handy C# Amazon.Lambda web framework.

# synopsis

Silly Widgets is a C# web framework, using .NET Core, that runs on Amazon's Lambda platform. Its goals are: A) cheaper hosting costs for smaller sites and B) simplify the configuration of AWS API Gateway and Lambda, which hopefully also simplifies development, deployment, management, and testing of C# lambda integrations.
